## [1.6.0+local-b1] - 2021-05-15
### Added
- Allow in-line comments in configuration file
- Added command line `dry-run` and config `dry_run` options
Use the `dry-run` option to see what changes would be made, but not make them
- Added option `prune_sanoid`
Use the `prune_sanoid` option to control if pyznap prunes existing sanoid snapshots
Note that the default has changed to NO


## [1.6.0] - 2020-09-22
### Added
- Added resumable send/receive.
Use the `resume` option in the config file or the `-r` flag for `pyznap send`.
- Added options `dest_auto_create`, `retries` and `retry_interval`.


## [1.5.0] - 2020-03-15
### Added
- Added zfs raw send for encrypted or compressed datasets.
Use the `raw_send` option in the config file or the `-w` flag for `pyznap send`.


## [1.4.3] - 2019-09-07
### Fixed
- pyznap would falsely assume executables such as 'pv' exist on SmartOS even when not present.


## [1.4.2] - 2019-08-30
### Fixed
- Catch DatasetNotFoundError if dataset was destroyed after starting pyznap.


## [1.4.1] - 2019-08-27
### Fixed
- Close stderr to detect broken pipe.
- Raise CalledProcessError if there is any error during zfs receive.


## [1.4.0] - 2019-08-27
### Added
- You can now exclude datasets when sending using [Unix shell-type wildcards](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html).
Use the `exclude` keyword in the config or the `-e` flag for `pyznap send`.


## [1.3.0] - 2019-08-22
### Added
- pyznap can now pull data over ssh, i.e. you can now send form local to local, local to remote,
remote to local and remote to remote. Note that remote to remote is not direct, but via the local
machine.
- `pv` now outputs status once per minute when stdout is redirected (e.g. to a file).

### Changed
- Rewrote local/remote 'zfs send' commands in a more uniform manner.

### Fixed
- Enforce python>=3.5 in setup.py.


## [1.2.1] - 2019-07-15
### Fixed
- Removed `configparser` dependency.


## [1.2.0] - 2019-07-14
### Added
- pyznap now uses compression for sending over ssh. Current supported methods are `none`, `lzop`
(default), `lz4`, `gzip`, `pigz`, `bzip2` and `xz`. There is a new config option (e.g. `compress = none`)
and a new flag `-c` for `pyznap send`.
- `mbuffer` is now also used on the dest when sending over ssh.

### Changed
- Rewrote how commands are executed over ssh: Implemented own SSH class, removed paramiko dependency.
- General code cleanup.


## [1.1.3] - 2019-07-14
### Fixed
- Send would fail on FreeBSD due to missing stream_size.


## [1.1.2] - 2018-11-27
### Added
- Catch KeyboardInterrupt exceptions.

### Changed
- Code cleanup.


## [1.1.1] - 2018-11-17
### Changed
- Changed frequency of 'frequent' snapshots to 1 minute. Interval at which 'frequent' snapshots
are taken can be controlled by cronjob. This allows users to take snapshots at different intervals
(1min, 5min, 15min, ...).
- Code cleanup in process.py. No more overwriting of subprocess functions.

### Fixed
- Fixed pv width to 100 chars.


## [1.1.0] - 2018-10-15
### Added
- pyznap now uses `pv` to show progress of zfs send operations.
- Better error handling during zfs send over ssh.

### Fixed
- Changed readme to only mention python 3.5+.


## [1.0.2] - 2018-08-15
### Added
- More verbose error messages when CalledProcessError is raised.

### Fixed

## [1.0.1] - 2018-08-13
### Added
- pyznap now checks if the dest filesystem has a 'zfs receive' ongoing before trying to send.
- Added more helpful error message when source/dest do not exist.
